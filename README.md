### 💻 Software Engineer | Computer Science Student at The University of Manchester 🚀

I’m a final-year Computer Science student at the University of Manchester, graduating in Summer 2025, with a strong passion for highly scalable solutions that drive business success.

Currently, I’m working as a Software Engineer at Novlr, where I developed a refer-a-friend system to increase signups and conversions, and contributed to a greenfield frontend to enhance user experience.

Previously, during my Technology Industrial Placement at UBS, I helped build a next-gen Asset Management platform managing over $5T AUM. I also developed GraphQL APIs, Kafka-based data processing solutions, and CI/CD libraries that boosted efficiency by 90%.

Beyond work and studies, I’m passionate about building side projects—I launched SongLinkr, an iOS app with 3,000+ organic downloads, and developed a trade order book in Go.

📌 Skills: .NET/C#, Kafka, Kubernetes, Swift, Python, JS/TS, GoLang, Java, C/C++, SystemVerilog
